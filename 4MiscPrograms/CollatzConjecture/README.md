## Collatz Conjecture in LabVIEW

This file demonstrates the Collatz Conjecture (or 3n + 1 problem) in PowerShell. This basically says to take any positive integer. If it's even, divide that number by 2. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The Collatz Conjecture states that by repeatedly following this pattern, you will eventually get back to 1. Here's the problem more formally stated by Wikipedia:

### Examples
* 7 -> 22 -> 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
